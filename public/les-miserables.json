        "title": "Impact of Electron-Electron Cusp on Configuration Interaction Energies",
        "summary": "The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration\ninteraction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the\npseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective\nelectron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the\nscattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero\nelectron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this\nsmooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.\nWe perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both\nwith the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective\nelectron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of\nthe wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not\nsignificantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction\nfor energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to\npopular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting\nfactor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.",

        "summary": "Starting from the shell structure in atoms and the significant correlation\nwithin electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between\ntwo electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the average\ncorrelation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of the\ncrystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of the\nvalence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy\nband above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap.\nIn order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we\ncalculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the\npolaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron\npairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to\ncounterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The\ninterplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested\nin the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is\nresponsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located\non the Fermi surface of the single-electron band.",

It clarifies the dominant parameter regime (e.g.,\nparallel core electron plasma beta $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$, core\nelectron temperature anisotropy $A_{\\mathrm{ec}}\\equiv\nT_{\\mathrm{ec\\perp}}/T_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$, and electron beam velocity\n$V_{\\mathrm{eb}}$) for each kind of electron instability (e.g., the electron\nbeam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electron\nbeam-driven whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotron\ninstability, the electron mirror instability, the electron firehose\ninstability, and the ordinary-mode instability). It finds that the electron\nbeam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in the\nlow-$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$ regime, and whistler waves in the medium-\nand large-$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$ regime.

Single-electron-electron-pair\nand electron-pair-electron-pair interaction terms appear in our Hamiltonian and\nthe interaction potentials can be determined from the electron-electron Coulomb\ninteractions.

        "summary": "Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to\nthe hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such\nan omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\\sim 300$\nkeV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in\ngeneral makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray\nspectrum steeper at high energies.\n  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot\nproduce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The\nmaximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of\nthe emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic\nfor an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated\nelectrons.\n  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show\nthat the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is\nnaturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.\nIndeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized\ninversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both\nelectron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral\nindex $\\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E\n= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron\nspectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy\nexists.",

        "summary": "The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on\nboth the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum\nMonte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used\nto quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron\ninteraction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous\nDiffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the\neffective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional\nelectron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field\nfactors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the\nelectron gas at metallic densities.\n  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At\nthe compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)\nterm and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron\ninteraction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large\ncancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than\neither term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the\nelectron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static\nelectron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less\nrepulsive for electrons with parallel spins.\n  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background\nis shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As a\nsimple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using\nthe measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.\nThe net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors\n$0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly repulsive for the\nother alkali metals.",

        "summary": "Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is pivotal for various fundamental spin-dependent\nphenomena in solids and their technological applications. In semiconductors,\nthese phenomena have been so far studied in relatively weak electron-electron\ninteraction regimes, where the single electron picture holds. However, SOC can\nprofoundly compete against Coulomb interaction, which could lead to the\nemergence of unconventional electronic phases. Since SOC depends on the\nelectric field in the crystal including contributions of itinerant electrons,\nelectron-electron interactions can modify this coupling. Here we demonstrate\nthe emergence of SOC effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system\nin a simple band structure MgZnO/ZnO semiconductor. This electron system\nfeatures also strong electron-electron interaction effects. By changing the\ncarrier density with Mg-content, we tune the SOC strength and achieve its\ninterplay with electron-electron interaction. These systems pave a way to\nemergent spintronic phenomena in strong electron correlation regime and to the\nformation of novel quasiparticles with the electron spin strongly coupled to\nthe density.",

        "summary": "The electronic behavior of various solid metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Au, Ti, and W)\nunder ultrashort laser irradiation is investigated by means of density\nfunctional theory. Successive stages of extreme nonequilibrium on picosecond\ntime scale impact the excited material properties in terms of optical coupling\nand transport characteristics. As these are generally modelled based on the\nfree-electron classical theory, the free-electron number is a key parameter.\nHowever, this parameter remains unclearly defined and dependencies on the\nelectronic temperature are not considered. Here, from first-principles\ncalculations, density of states are obtained with respect to electronic\ntemperatures varying from 10^-2 to 10^5 K within a cold lattice. Based on the\nconcept of localized or delocalized electronic states, temperature dependent\nfree-electron numbers are evaluated for a series of metals covering a large\nrange of electronic configurations. With the increase of the electronic\ntemperature we observe strong adjustments of the electronic structures of\ntransition metals. These are related to variations of electronic occupation in\nlocalized d bands, via change in electronic screening and electron-ion\neffective potential. The electronic temperature dependence of nonequilibrium\ndensity of states has consequences on electronic chemical potentials,\nfree-electron numbers, electronic heat capacities, and electronic pressures.\nThus electronic thermodynamic properties are computed and discussed, serving as\na base to derive energetic and transport properties allowing the description of\nexcitation and relaxation phenomena caused by rapid laser action.",

The D'yakonov-Perel'\nspin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron-hole\nscattering, with small corrections from electron-electron scattering and\nvirtually none from electron-impurity scattering. We derive simple expressions\n(one-dimensional and two-dimensional integrals respectively) for the effective\nelectron-hole and electron-electron scattering rates which enter the spin\nrelaxation time calculation. The electron-hole scattering rate is found to be\ncomparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid - a\ncommon model for n-type doped semiconductors. As the density of electron-hole\npairs decreases (within the degenerate regime), a strong enhancement of the\nscattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation is\npredicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron-hole liquid.\nIn the opposite limit of high density, the original D'yakonov-Perel' model\nfails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by free\nprecession of individual quasiparticle spins.",

The subsequent electronic evolutions in terms of band\nstructure and energy distribution can determine the change of several\nthermodynamic properties, including one essential for energy deposition; the\nelectronic heat capacity. Using density functional calculations performed at\nfinite electronic temperatures, the electronic heat capacities dependent on\nelectronic temperatures are obtained for a series of metals, including free\nelectron like, transition and noble metals. The effect of exchange and\ncorrelation functionals and the presence of semicore electrons on electronic\nheat capacities are first evaluated and found to be negligible in most cases.\nThen, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying the\nnumber of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can be\ncorrectly fitted with these approaches. For transition metals, the presence of\nlocalized d electrons produces a strong deviation toward high energies of the\nelectronic heat capacities, implying that more energy is needed to thermally\nexcite them, compared to free sp electrons. This is attributed to collective\nexcitation effects strengthened by a change of the electronic screening at high\ntemperature.",

Our\nderivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the\ncoupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation\nwhereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear\nmovement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce\nto previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.\nHamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is\nsymmetric.

        "summary": "The number of electronic bands is usually considered invariant regardless of\nthe electron density in a band picture. However, in interacting systems, the\nspectral-weight distribution generally changes depending on the electron\ndensity, and electronic states can even emerge or disappear as the electron\ndensity changes. Here, to clarify how electronic states emerge and become\ndominant as the electron density changes, the spectral function of the Hubbard\nladder with strong repulsion and strong intrarung hopping is studied using the\nnon-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization-group method. A mode\nemerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as the\nelectron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics at\nquarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in the\nlow-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Mott\ntransition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion\nrelation in the small-doping limit. This paper identifies the origin of the\nelectronic states responsible for the Mott transition and brings a new\nperspective to electronic bands by revealing the overall nature of electronic\nstates over a wide energy and electron-density regime.",

        "summary": "Suprathermal electrons and inertial drifting electrons, so called electron\nbeam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves\nobserved in several astrophysical plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of\nelectron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless,\nunmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot\nsuprathermal electrons (modeled by a $\\kappa$-type distribution), and\nstationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A\nlinear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave\nstructures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam\nvelocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to\nobtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate\nhow their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical properties\nof the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $\\kappa$) of the hot\nelectrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the\nelectron-acoustic solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity\nsolitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-propagates with the\nsolitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes\nnarrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the\nbeam-to-hot electron temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool\nelectron density ratio in high suprathermality (low $\\kappa$). It is found that\nthe electric potential amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam\nspeed and the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating solitary\nwaves, but is slightly decreased by raising the beam-to-hot electron\ntemperature ratio.",

In this paper, we analyze interaction of a pair of electrons with\nsuch an energy dispersion. We show that relative motion of the electron pair is\nof a very peculiar character. For example, the real space trajectories\ncorresponding to electron-electron scattering can have three reversal points,\nreversal points at non-zero radial momentum and other unusual features. Despite\nthe repulsive Coulomb interaction, two electrons can be coupled forming a\ncomposite quasi-particle - the bi-electron. The bi-electron corresponds to\nexcited states of the two-electron system. Because the bi-electron coupled\nstates exist in continuum of extended (free) states of the electron pair, these\nstates are quasi-resonant and have finite times of life. We found that rotating\nbi-electron is a long-living composite quasi-particle. The rotating\nbi-electrons can be in motion. For slowly moving bi-electrons, we determined\nthe kinetic energy and the effective mass. Due to strongly nonparabolic energy\ndispersion, the translational motion of the bi-electron is coupled to its\ninternal motion. This results in effective masses dependent on quantum states\nof the bi-electron. In the paper, properties of the bi-electron are illustrated\nfor the example of bigraphene in a transverse electric field.",

HREELS is used to measure the modulations of\nelectron transition probabilities from incoming electrons in vacuum to outgoing\nelectrons in vacuum where the transition includes one-phonon scattering\nprocesses inside a solid. Determining the electronic band structures of\ngraphite with VLEED, we defined electronic states of the solid surface that\nelectrons entered before and after scattering off phonons. Thus, we observed\nthat the measured electron transition probabilities significantly depended on\nwhether the electrons were in a bulk Bloch state or an evanescent state before\nscattering off the phonons.

        "title": "Quantum-coherent light-electron interaction in an SEM",
        "summary": "The last two decades experimentally affirmed the quantum nature of free\nelectron wavepackets by the rapid development of transmission electron\nmicroscopes into ultrafast, quantum-coherent systems. In particular, ultrafast\nelectron pulses can be generated and timed to interact with optical\nnear-fields, yielding coherent exchange of the quantized photon energy between\nthe relativistic electron wavepacket and the light field. So far, all\nexperiments have been restricted to the physically-confining bounds of\ntransmission electron microscopes, with their small, millimeter-sized sample\nchambers. In this work, we show the quantum coherent coupling between electrons\nand light in a scanning electron microscope, at unprecedentedly low electron\nenergies down to 10.4 keV, so with sub-relativistic electrons. Scanning\nelectron microscopes not only afford the yet-unexplored electron energies from\n~0.5 to 30 keV providing optimum light-coupling efficiencies, but they also\noffer spacious and easily-configurable experimental chambers for extended and\ncascaded optical set-ups, potentially boasting thousands of photon-electron\ninteraction zones. Our results unleashes the full potential of quantum\nexperiments including electron wavepacket shaping and quantum computing with\nmultiple arithmetic operations and will allow imaging with low-energy electrons\nand attosecond time resolution.",

        "title": "Electrons surfing on a sound wave as a platform for quantum optics with\n  flying electrons",
        "summary": "Electrons in a metal are indistinguishable particles that strongly interact\nwith other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single\nflying electron after propagation to perform quantum optics like experiments at\nthe single electron level is therefore a challenging task. Up to date, only few\nexperiments have been performed in a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas\nwhere the electron propagates almost ballistically. Flying electrons were\ndetected via the current generated by an ensemble of electrons and electron\ncorrelations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the\nexperimental realisation of high efficiency single electron source and single\nelectron detector for a quantum medium where a single electron is propagating\nisolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving\npotential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single\nelectron along the 1D-channel at a speed of 3\\mum/ns. When such a quantum\nchannel is placed between two quantum dots, a single electron can be\ntransported from one quantum dot to the other, which is several micrometres\napart, with a quantum efficiency of emission and detection of 96% and 92%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a\ntimescale shorter than the coherence time T2* of GaAs spin qubits6. Our work\nopens new avenues to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the\ndistant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed matter\nsystem.",

        "summary": "Free electrons are essential in such diverse applications as electron\nmicroscopes, accelerators, and photo-emission spectroscopy. Often, space charge\neffects of many electrons are a nuisance. Confined to extremely small\nspace-time dimensions, even two electrons can interact strongly. In this case,\nthe Coulomb repulsion can now be highly advantageous, because it leads to\nsurprisingly powerful electron-electron correlations, as we demonstrate here.\nWe show that femtosecond laser-emitted electrons from nanometric needle tips\nare highly anti-correlated in energy because of dynamic Coulomb repulsion, with\na visibility of $56\\,\\%$. We extract a mean energy splitting of $3.3\\,$eV and a\ncorrelation decay time of $82\\,$fs. Importantly, the energy-filtered electrons\ndisplay a sub-Poissonian number distribution with a second order correlation\nfunction as small as $g^{(2)} = 0.34$, implying that shot noise-reduced pulsed\nelectron beams can be realized based on simple energy filtering. Even heralded\nelectrons could become available for quantum-enhanced electron imaging\nprotocols. Furthermore, we also reach the strong-field regime of laser-driven\nelectron emission. We gain deep insights into how the electron correlations of\nthe different electron classes (direct vs. rescattered) are influenced by the\nstrong laser fields. Our work levels the field of quantum electron optics, with\ndirect ramifications for shot noise-reduced and quantum electron imaging as\nwell as direct measurements of correlated electrons from inside of strongly\ncorrelated matter.",

The theory, which is applicable to\nultrafast-laser excited metals, is based on the Boltzmann transport equation\nfor the carrier distribution function $f(\\epsilon,t)$ and includes\nelectron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-photon scattering integrals in\nforms that explicitly depend on the electronic density of states.\nElectron-phonon coupling is treated by extending the theory of Allen [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 59, 1460 (1987)] to include highly-excited nonthermal electron\ndistributions, and is used to determine the energy transfer rate between a\nnonthermal electron subsystem and a thermal phonon subsystem. Electron-electron\nscattering is treated with a simple energy-conserving electron-electron\nscattering integral. The electron-photon integral assumes photon absorption is\nphonon assisted. We apply the theory to analyze prior ultrafast thermionic\nemission, two-color photoemission, and electronic inelastic light (Raman)\nscattering experiments on Au. These analyses show that getting the details of\n$f(\\epsilon,t)$ is necessary for proper interpretation of each experiment.\nTogether, the photoemission and Raman-scattering analyses indicate an electron\nexcited 1 eV above the Fermi level has an electron-electron scattering time in\nthe range of 25 to 55 fs.",

A canonical transformation\nextracts an effective two-body problem from the many-body theory. As a\nprototype system we study the $\\cu$ cluster, which yields electronic pairing in\nthe Hubbard model; moreover, a standard treatment of the Jahn-Teller effect\npredicts distortions that destroy electronic pairing. Remarkably, calculations\nthat keep all the electronic spectrum into account show that vibrations are\nlikely to be synergic with electronic pairing, if the coupling to\nhalf-breathing modes predominates, as experiments suggest.",

We find that the detector signal consists of\nquasiballistic electrons, which either have not undergone any electron-electron\ncollisions or have only been scattered at small angles. Theoretically, the\nsmall-angle scattering exhibits distinct features that can be traced back to\nthe reduced dimensionality of the electron system. A number of nonlinear\neffects, also related to the two-dimensional character of the system, are\ndiscussed. In the simplest situation, the heating of the electron gas by the\nhigh-energy part of the beam leads to a weakening of the signal of\nquasiballistic electrons and to the appearance of thermovoltage. This results\nin a nonmonotonic dependence of the detector signal on the intensity of the\ninjected beam, as observed experimentally.",

        "summary": "When atoms are organized into a crystal, the single-electron energy levels of\nindividual atoms form energy bands. However, there also exist electron-pair\nstates in atoms. We found previously that the counterpart of these\nelectron-pair states of individual atoms may survive in a two-dimensional\nsquare-lattice crystal. When the amplitude of the crystal potential is larger\nthan a certain value, a metastable electron-pair band arises between the two\nlowest single-electron energy bands. In this paper, we demonstrate that the\nmany-particle exchange-correlation corrections renormalize the energy bands and\nmay stabilize the electron pairs for certain hole and electron-pair densities\nin the two-dimensional crystal. Therefore, depending upon the crystal potential\nand free carrier densities, there may exist a new many-particle system\nconsisting of electron pairs and holes. Furthermore, we calculate the\ncharge-density excitation spectrum in this new many-particle system.",

These phase modulations enable electron\nwavefront shaping and benefit electron microscopy, spectroscopy, lithography,\nand interferometry. However, in the fabrication of electron phase plates, the\ntypically used focused-ion-beam-milling method limits the fabrication\nthroughput and hence the active area of the phase plates. Here, we fabricated\nlarge-area electron phase plates with electron-beam lithography and\nreactive-ion-etching. The phase plates are characterized by electron\ndiffraction in transmission electron microscopes with various electron\nenergies, as well as diffractive imaging in a scanning electron microscope. We\nfound the phase plates could produce a null in the center of the bright-field\nbased on coherent interference of diffractive beams. Our work adds capabilities\nto the fabrication of electron phase plates. The nullification of the direct\nbeam and the tunable diffraction efficiency demonstrated here also paves the\nway towards novel dark-field electron-microscopy techniques and tunable\nelectron phase plates.",

        "summary": "Suprathermal tails are a common feature of solar wind electron velocity\ndistributions, and are expected in the solar corona. From the corona,\nsuprathermal electrons can propagate through the steep temperature gradient of\nthe transition region towards the chromosphere, and lead to non-Maxwellian\nelectron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) with pronounced suprathermal\ntails. We calculate the evolution of a coronal electron distribution through\nthe transition region in order to quantify the suprathermal electron population\nthere. A kinetic model for electrons is used which is based on solving the\nBoltzmann-Vlasov equation for electrons including Coulomb collisions with both\nions and electrons. Initial and chromospheric boundary conditions are\nMaxwellian VDFs with densities and temperatures based on a background fluid\nmodel. The coronal boundary condition has been adopted from earlier studies of\nsuprathermal electron formation in coronal loops. The model results show the\npresence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs,\nstarting at energies of a few 10 eV. Above electron energies of 600 eV,\nelectrons can traverse the transition region essentially collision-free. The\npresence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs shows\nthat the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not justified there.\nThis has a significant impact on ionization dynamics, as is shown in a\ncompanion paper.",

        "summary": "Rejuvenation of hydrodynamic transport in solids provides a new window to\nstudy collective motion of electrons, where electrons behave like a viscous\nfluid akin to classical liquids. Experimental observations of such exotic\nstates have not been realized until recent years, and an on-going quest is to\namplify the hydrodynamic effect in electron fluids. Here we investigate the\nhydrodynamic properties of Dirac electron fluid in graphene from a microscopic\nviewpoint, and elucidate a novel way to enhance electron hydrodynamics. In\nparticular, we present strong evidence that the shear viscosity of Dirac\nelectrons can be enhanced by frequent electron-hole collisions, through three\ndistinct aspects: promoting electrons and holes around the Dirac point by\ndisorder, creating electron-hole shared zeroth Landau level by external\nmagnetic field, and inducing electron-hole excitations by dynamic deformation.\nWe also study Hall viscosity, which is closely related to the geometric\ntopology and exhibits quantum behavior analogous to Hall conductivity.\nTherefore, our work demonstrates the exotic landscape of hydrodynamic\nelectronics in graphene, and presents experimentally relevant responses to\nquantify the effects of electronic viscosity.",

We proposed that\nsuperconductivity in solids only occurs when the Fermi level is close to the\ntop of a band (hole carriers), that it originates in `undressing' of carriers\nfrom $both$ the electron-electron and the electron-ion interaction, and that as\na consequence holes in the normal state behave like electrons in the\nsuperconducting state[3]. However, the connection between both undressing\neffects was left unclear, as was left unclear how the transformation from hole\nbehavior to electron behavior occurs. Here we clarify these questions by\nshowing that the same electron-electron interaction physics that promotes\npairing of hole carriers and undressing of carriers from the electron-electron\ninteraction leads to undressing of carriers from the electron-ion interaction\nand transforms the behavior of carriers from hole-like to electron-like.\nFurthermore this phenomenon is connected with the expulsion of negative charge\nthat we predict to occur in superconductors. These unexpected connections\nsupport the validity of our theoretical framework, the theory of hole\nsuperconductivity, to explain superconductivity in solids.",

We discuss the effect of the electron-electron\nCoulomb interaction on spin relaxation under various conditions. It is shown\nthat the electron-electron Coulomb scattering plays an important role in spin\nrelaxation at high temperature. We also find a significant increase of the spin\nrelaxation time for high spin polarization even at room temperature, which is\ndue to the Coulomb Hartree-Fock contribution-induced effective longitudinal\nmagnetic field. It is also discovered that the spin relaxation time increases\nwith the in-plane electric field due to the hot-electron effect, which is\ndifferent from the non-monotonic behavior in semiconductors. Moreover, we show\nthat the electron-electron Coulomb scattering in graphene is not strong enough\nto establish the steady-state hot-electron distribution in the literature and\nan alternative approximate one is proposed based on our computation.",

        "summary": "Coulomb blockade is a fundamental phenomenon in physics enabling transfer of\nindividual electrons one by one into electrically isolated nanostructures such\nas nanowires or quantum dots and thereby creation of sources of single\nelectrons. Nowadays, solid-state single-electron sources are key elements of\nthe emerging new technologies of quantum information processing and\nsingle-electron electronics. Moreover, advanced research in free-electron\nquantum optics and developments in electron microscopy require the point\nsources of free electrons in vacuum, which can be controlled on a single\nelectron level. However, up to now, single-electron vacuum guns were not\nrealized in practice. The problems to be solved include the formation of stable\ntip-shaped heterostructured emitters and control of liberated electrons in time\nand energy domain. Here we overcome these challenges by creating a field\nemission (FE) electron source based on a carbon nanowire coupled to an\nultra-sharp diamond tip by a tunnel junction. Using energy spectroscopy, we\ndirectly observe Coulomb oscillations of the electron Fermi level in the\nnanowire at room temperature and FE currents up to 1 $\\mu$A. We reveal that the\noscillations are suppressed at high FE current either by Joule heating or due\nto the high tunneling resistance, depending on the nanowire charging time,\nranging from about 25 fs to 1 ps. We anticipate that the combination of\nintroduced carbon single-electron sources with laser-induced gating is highly\npromising for the creation of coherent ultrashort free-electron bunches of\ninterest for low-energy electron holography and ultrafast electron or X-ray\nimaging and spectroscopy.",
